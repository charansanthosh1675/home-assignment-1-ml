### Question 7: Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

#### Objective
To implement linear regression using Gradient Descent from scratch and compare it with the closed-form Normal Equation solution.

#### Dataset
Synthetic data generated using:
y = 3 + 4x + noise  
200 samples with x ∈ [0,5]

#### Methods Used
- Closed-form solution using Normal Equation
- Gradient Descent optimization

#### Results
Both methods produced nearly identical intercept and slope values.  
The gradient descent loss curve shows smooth convergence.

#### Conclusion
Gradient Descent converges to the same optimal solution as the closed-form method when properly tuned.
